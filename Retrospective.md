## 1. Reflect on (think about) the work you did for the challenge. How did you do? What did you get right? What did you get wrong? What did you do differently (and possibly better) than what was posted in the solution? What was hard to do?

I finsished the homework with a working solution. I did get a little help from a friend but we ended up
having different solutions for the checkerboard. I think he did have to mess with scene builder to get
his to work so that is where I think I could have possibly messed up. I have guess I could have made my 
controller look similiar to yours by making cases and breaks.

## 2. How well did you understand the programming concepts and foundational knowledge needed to complete the challenge?

I felt a little lost at first but that is me. I always have difficulty starting coding assignments. But
there were many resources on canvas to help me accomplish this homework.

## 3. How well did you meet the requirements as set out in the challenge? What requirements did you not meet correctly (if any)?

I think I had all the requirements if I remember correctly. If I had to grade myself I would give myself 
100% because I completed all the goals on the homework.

## 4. How well does your solution match the posted solution? What is different?

Our controllers are very different but everything else is very similar. 

## 5. How could you improve going forward? What don't you still understand that was required for the challenge?

I guess I could get a better understanding of stage and manipulation of the stage.
